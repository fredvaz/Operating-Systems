# Operating-Systems
Class of Operating Systems in Electrical and Computer Engineering Degree

I made this in OS X it's based on Unix but in some cases it's different of Ubuntu Linux like:

- core dump directory that is /cores and file core is core.PID;
- GDB is no more support apple moved to LLDB but you can install gdb-apple it's like GDB;
